## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Add Tasks (Priority: P1)

Users need to add new todo tasks with both a title and description to their list.

**Why this priority**: Adding tasks is the fundamental functionality of a todo application - without it, the app has no purpose.

**Independent Test**: User can run `todo add "Buy groceries" "Get milk, bread, and eggs"` and see confirmation that the task was added with both title and description.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** user wants to add a task, **When** user runs `todo add "Buy groceries" "Get milk, bread, and eggs"`, **Then** task is added to the list with both title and description, and a confirmation message is shown
2. **Given** user tries to add a task with empty title, **When** user runs `todo add "" "Description"`, **Then** an error message is shown and task is not added

---

### User Story 2 - List Tasks (Priority: P1)

Users need to view all their todo tasks with ID, title, description, and completion status.

**Why this priority**: Viewing tasks is essential for users to know what they need to do and track their progress.

**Independent Test**: User can run `todo list` and see all tasks with their ID, title, description, and completion status clearly displayed.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** user has added tasks, **When** user runs `todo list`, **Then** all tasks are displayed with ID, title, description, and completion status
2. **Given** user has no tasks, **When** user runs `todo list`, **Then** a message "No tasks found." is displayed

---

### User Story 3 - Mark Tasks Complete/Incomplete (Priority: P2)

Users need to be able to mark tasks as complete or change them back to incomplete.

**Why this priority**: Completing tasks is a core part of the todo workflow that allows users to track their progress.

**Independent Test**: User can run `todo complete 1` to mark task with ID 1 as complete and `todo incomplete 1` to change it back to incomplete.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** user has tasks, **When** user runs `todo complete 1`, **Then** the task with ID 1 is marked as complete
2. **Given** user has completed tasks, **When** user runs `todo incomplete 1`, **Then** the task with ID 1 is marked as incomplete

---

### User Story 4 - Update Task Details (Priority: P3)

Users need to be able to update the title or description of existing tasks by ID.

**Why this priority**: Users may need to modify task details without deleting and re-adding the task.

**Independent Test**: User can run `todo update 1 --title "New Title"` or `todo update 1 --description "New Description"` to modify specific parts of a task.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** user has tasks, **When** user runs `todo update 1 --title "New Title"`, **Then** the title of task with ID 1 is updated while preserving the description
2. **Given** user has tasks, **When** user runs `todo update 1 --description "New Description"`, **Then** the description of task with ID 1 is updated while preserving the title

---

### User Story 5 - Delete Tasks (Priority: P3)

Users need to be able to remove tasks from their list by ID.

**Why this priority**: Users want to clean up their todo list by removing completed or irrelevant tasks.

**Independent Test**: User can run `todo delete 1` to remove the task with ID 1 from the list.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** user has tasks, **When** user runs `todo delete 1`, **Then** the task with ID 1 is removed from the list
2. **Given** user provides invalid ID, **When** user runs `todo delete 99`, **Then** an error message is shown

### Edge Cases

- What happens when user tries to access an ID that doesn't exist?
- How does system handle very long task titles or descriptions?
- What happens with special characters in task titles or descriptions?
- How does the system handle multiple users accessing it simultaneously (if applicable)?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST allow users to add new tasks with both title and description
- **FR-002**: System MUST display all tasks with their ID, title, description, and completion status
- **FR-003**: System MUST allow users to mark tasks as complete by ID
- **FR-004**: System MUST allow users to mark tasks as incomplete by ID
- **FR-005**: System MUST allow users to update task title by ID
- **FR-006**: System MUST allow users to update task description by ID
- **FR-007**: System MUST allow users to delete tasks by ID
- **FR-008**: System MUST validate that task IDs exist before operations
- **FR-009**: System MUST validate that task titles are not empty
- **FR-010**: System MUST provide clear error messages for invalid operations
- **FR-011**: System MUST use in-memory storage only (no file or database persistence)

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*

- **Task**: Represents a single todo item with ID, title, description, and completion status
- **TaskList**: Manages the collection of tasks and provides operations on them
- **TodoCLI**: Command-line interface that allows users to interact with the task management system

## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*

### Measurable Outcomes

- **SC-001**: Users can add, view, update, delete, and mark tasks as complete/incomplete through command-line interface
- **SC-002**: All 5 core operations (Add, List, Update, Delete, Complete/Incomplete) are functional and tested
- **SC-003**: Error handling prevents unhandled exceptions during normal use
- **SC-004**: Users can successfully manage tasks with title and description through simple text commands
- **SC-005**: Application follows Python 3.13+ standards and uses only in-memory storage as specified
