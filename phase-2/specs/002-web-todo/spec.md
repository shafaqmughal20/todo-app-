## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - User Registration and Authentication (Priority: P1)

A new user visits the web application and wants to create an account to manage their personal tasks. The user provides their email and password, completes the registration process, and receives confirmation of their account creation.

**Why this priority**: Authentication is the foundation for multi-user support and data isolation. Without this, no other functionality can be properly implemented since tasks need to be associated with specific users.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by registering a new user account and verifying the account is created in the system, delivering the core value of user identity management.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a visitor is on the signup page, **When** they enter valid email and password and submit the form, **Then** they receive a confirmation message and are redirected to the login page
2. **Given** a new user has registered, **When** they enter their credentials on the login page, **Then** they are authenticated and redirected to their personal todo dashboard

---

### User Story 2 - Basic Todo Management (Priority: P1)

An authenticated user wants to manage their personal tasks by creating, viewing, updating, and deleting todo items. The user can see a list of their tasks, add new tasks, mark tasks as complete, and remove tasks they no longer need.

**Why this priority**: This represents the core functionality of the todo application - the ability to manage tasks is the primary value proposition for users.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by creating, viewing, updating, and deleting tasks, delivering the core todo management functionality.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** an authenticated user is on their dashboard, **When** they enter a new task description and submit, **Then** the task appears in their task list
2. **Given** an authenticated user has tasks in their list, **When** they mark a task as complete, **Then** the task is visually marked as completed and the status is saved
3. **Given** an authenticated user has tasks in their list, **When** they delete a task, **Then** the task is removed from their list and the database

### User Story 3 - Task Management via Web Interface (Priority: P2)

An authenticated user wants to interact with their tasks through a responsive web interface that works across different devices. The interface should provide clear visual feedback and intuitive controls for managing tasks.

**Why this priority**: While the core functionality exists, the user experience is crucial for adoption. A responsive, well-designed interface makes the application accessible and enjoyable to use.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by using the web interface to perform all task management operations on different screen sizes, delivering a polished user experience.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** an authenticated user is using the application on a mobile device, **When** they interact with the interface, **Then** all elements are properly sized and positioned for touch interaction
2. **Given** an authenticated user is managing tasks, **When** they perform actions, **Then** they receive appropriate visual feedback (loading states, success/error messages)

### User Story 4 - API Access with Authentication (Priority: P2)

A developer or third-party application wants to access todo functionality programmatically through an API. The API requires authentication to ensure data isolation between users.

**Why this priority**: API access enables extensibility and integration possibilities, while authentication ensures security and proper data isolation.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by making authenticated API calls to create, read, update, and delete tasks, delivering programmatic access to core functionality.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a client has valid authentication credentials, **When** they make an API request to retrieve tasks, **Then** they receive only their own tasks
2. **Given** a client has invalid or expired authentication credentials, **When** they make an API request, **Then** they receive an unauthorized response

### Edge Cases

- What happens when a user tries to access another user's tasks?
- How does the system handle concurrent updates to the same task?
- What happens when a user's JWT token expires during a session?
- How does the system handle network failures during API calls?
- What happens when a user attempts to create a task with invalid or empty content?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST allow users to create accounts with email and password
- **FR-002**: System MUST authenticate users via secure credentials
- **FR-003**: Users MUST be able to sign in and receive authentication credentials for API access
- **FR-004**: System MUST persist user accounts in secure storage
- **FR-005**: System MUST allow authenticated users to create new todo tasks
- **FR-006**: System MUST allow authenticated users to view their own tasks only
- **FR-007**: System MUST allow authenticated users to update their tasks (mark as complete, edit content)
- **FR-008**: System MUST allow authenticated users to delete their tasks
- **FR-009**: System MUST provide a responsive web interface for task management
- **FR-010**: System MUST provide API endpoints for task operations
- **FR-011**: System MUST validate authentication credentials for all authenticated API requests
- **FR-012**: System MUST ensure data isolation so users can only access their own tasks
- **FR-013**: System MUST handle authentication failures gracefully with appropriate error messages
- **FR-014**: System MUST provide appropriate feedback and error handling in the UI

### Key Entities

- **User**: Represents a registered user with email, password (hashed), and account metadata
- **Task**: Represents a todo item with title, description, completion status, creation date, and user association
- **Session**: Represents an authenticated user session with JWT token validity

## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*

### Measurable Outcomes

- **SC-001**: Users can complete account registration and sign in within 2 minutes
- **SC-002**: Users can create, view, update, and delete tasks with less than 3 seconds response time
- **SC-003**: 95% of users successfully complete the primary task management workflow (add, complete, delete tasks)
- **SC-004**: API endpoints return appropriate responses for authenticated requests with 99% success rate
- **SC-005**: Users can access the application on desktop, tablet, and mobile devices with responsive layout
- **SC-006**: Data isolation is maintained with 100% accuracy - users cannot access other users' tasks
