# Feature Specification: Todo Application Core Features

**Feature Branch**: `phase-1-todo-app`
**Created**: 2025-12-28
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Command-line todo application in Python with Add, Delete, Update, View, Mark Complete features"

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Add Todo Items (Priority: P1)

Users need to be able to add new todo items to their list.

**Why this priority**: Adding tasks is the fundamental functionality of a todo application - without it, the app has no purpose.

**Independent Test**: User can run `todo add "Buy groceries"` and see confirmation that the task was added.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** user wants to add a task, **When** user runs `todo add "Buy groceries"`, **Then** task is added to the list and confirmation message is shown
2. **Given** user tries to add an empty task, **When** user runs `todo add ""`, **Then** an error message is shown and task is not added

---

### User Story 2 - View Todo Items (Priority: P1)

Users need to be able to view all their todo items with their completion status.

**Why this priority**: Viewing tasks is essential for users to know what they need to do.

**Independent Test**: User can run `todo list` and see all tasks with their completion status.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** user has added tasks, **When** user runs `todo list`, **Then** all tasks are displayed with their completion status
2. **Given** user has no tasks, **When** user runs `todo list`, **Then** a message "No tasks found." is displayed

---

### User Story 3 - Mark Todo Items as Complete (Priority: P2)

Users need to be able to mark tasks as complete to track their progress.

**Why this priority**: Completing tasks is a core part of the todo workflow.

**Independent Test**: User can run `todo complete 0` to mark the first task as complete.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** user has tasks, **When** user runs `todo complete 0`, **Then** the task at index 0 is marked as complete
2. **Given** user provides invalid index, **When** user runs `todo complete 99`, **Then** an error message is shown

---

### User Story 4 - Update Todo Items (Priority: P3)

Users need to be able to update the text of existing todo items.

**Why this priority**: Users may need to modify task descriptions without deleting and re-adding.

**Independent Test**: User can run `todo update 0 "Updated task"` to change the first task's description.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** user has tasks, **When** user runs `todo update 0 "Updated task"`, **Then** the task at index 0 is updated with the new description
2. **Given** user provides invalid index, **When** user runs `todo update 99 "New task"`, **Then** an error message is shown

---

### User Story 5 - Delete Todo Items (Priority: P3)

Users need to be able to remove completed or unnecessary tasks from their list.

**Why this priority**: Users want to clean up their todo list by removing completed or irrelevant tasks.

**Independent Test**: User can run `todo delete 0` to remove the first task from the list.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** user has tasks, **When** user runs `todo delete 0`, **Then** the task at index 0 is removed from the list
2. **Given** user provides invalid index, **When** user runs `todo delete 99`, **Then** an error message is shown

### Edge Cases

- What happens when user tries to access an index that doesn't exist?
- How does system handle very long task descriptions?
- What happens with special characters in task descriptions?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST allow users to add new todo items with descriptions
- **FR-002**: System MUST allow users to view all todo items with completion status
- **FR-003**: System MUST allow users to mark todo items as complete
- **FR-004**: System MUST allow users to update todo item descriptions
- **FR-005**: System MUST allow users to delete todo items by index
- **FR-006**: System MUST validate that task descriptions are not empty
- **FR-007**: System MUST validate that task indices exist before operations
- **FR-008**: System MUST display completion status with clear indicators (X/O)

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*

- **TodoItem**: Represents a single todo item with task description and completion status
- **TodoService**: Manages the collection of TodoItems and provides operations on them
- **TodoApp**: Command-line interface that allows users to interact with the TodoService

## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*

### Measurable Outcomes

- **SC-001**: Users can add, view, update, delete, and mark tasks as complete through command-line interface
- **SC-002**: All 5 core features (Add, Delete, Update, View, Mark Complete) are functional and tested
- **SC-003**: Error handling prevents unhandled exceptions during normal use
- **SC-004**: Code follows PEP 8 standards and project constitution guidelines
