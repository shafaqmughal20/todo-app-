# Prompt History Record

## PROMPT_TEXT
Create: high-level architecture, monorepo folder structure, development phases, validation steps.
Decisions needing documentation: choices for data models (SQLModel schemas), auth integration (JWT secret sharing), API client in frontend (fetch vs axios), database connection (env vars).
Testing strategy: manual test cases for each feature and endpoint, edge cases like unauthorized access or invalid tokens, integration tests for frontend-backend communication.
Technical details:

Use monorepo with Spec-Kit structure
Follow guidelines from CLAUDE.md files
Organize by phases: Spec refinement → Backend implementation → Frontend implementation → Integration and auth
Reference specs like @specs/features/task-crud.md during implementation

## RESPONSE_TEXT
Created comprehensive implementation plan for the full-stack web todo application with:

1. Implementation Plan (plan.md): High-level architecture with Next.js frontend, FastAPI backend, and Neon PostgreSQL database, following monorepo structure with clear separation between frontend and backend components.

2. Research Document (research.md): Detailed development phases (Backend → Frontend → Integration), key architectural decisions on data models (SQLModel), authentication (Better Auth with JWT), API client choice (fetch API), and database connection strategy.

3. Data Model (data-model.md): Complete SQLModel schemas for User and Task entities with proper relationships, validation, and CRUD operation models.

4. Quickstart Guide (quickstart.md): Complete setup instructions, environment configuration, and validation steps for backend, frontend, and integration testing.

5. API Contracts (contracts/task-crud.md, contracts/auth-api.md): Detailed API specifications for task management and authentication endpoints with request/response formats and error handling.

6. Testing Strategy (contracts/testing-strategy.md): Comprehensive testing approach covering unit, integration, and end-to-end testing with manual test cases, automated tests, and edge case scenarios.

7. Implementation Tasks (tasks.md): Detailed task breakdown organized by development phases with specific implementation steps.

All artifacts follow the Spec-Kit structure and CLAUDE.md guidelines with proper separation of concerns and validation steps.

## OUTCOME
Successfully created complete planning artifacts for the full-stack web todo application implementation, including architecture, data models, API contracts, testing strategy, and implementation tasks.

## EVALUATION
All planning requirements were addressed with appropriate documentation of architectural decisions, testing strategies, and implementation phases. The plan provides a clear roadmap for implementation following the specified monorepo structure.
