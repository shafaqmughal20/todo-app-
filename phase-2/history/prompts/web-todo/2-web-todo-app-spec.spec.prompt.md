## RESPONSE_TEXT
Created comprehensive specification for the full-stack web todo application. The specification includes:

- User scenarios prioritized by importance (P1-P2) covering user registration, task management, responsive interface, and API access
- Functional requirements (FR-001 to FR-014) covering account management, task operations, authentication, data isolation, and UI feedback
- Key entities (User, Task, Session) defining the core data structures
- Success criteria (SC-001 to SC-006) with measurable outcomes for user experience, performance, and data isolation

The specification follows the template structure and focuses on user value and business needs without implementation details. It removes technology-specific constraints from the original description to maintain technology-agnostic approach while preserving the core requirements.

## OUTCOME
Successfully created a comprehensive specification for the full-stack web todo application that aligns with the feature requirements and follows spec-driven development principles.

## EVALUATION
The specification is complete with all mandatory sections filled, requirements are testable and unambiguous, success criteria are measurable and technology-agnostic, and all acceptance scenarios are defined. The specification is ready for the planning phase.
