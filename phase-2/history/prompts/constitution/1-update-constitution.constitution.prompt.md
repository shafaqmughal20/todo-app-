# Prompt History Record

## PROMPT_TEXT
Project: Full-stack web todo application
Core principles:

Spec-driven development using Spec-Kit Plus and Claude Code
Separation of concerns between frontend and backend
Secure authentication and data isolation per user
Responsive and user-friendly web interface
Persistent storage with relational database
Key standards:
All features must be testable via manual interaction and API testing
Error handling for invalid inputs, authentication failures, and database errors
Code organization: Monorepo structure with /frontend, /backend, /specs, CLAUDE.md files
Documentation: Inline comments, docstrings, and spec references
Version control: Git commits with meaningful messages
Constraints:
Technology: Next.js 16+ (App Router) for frontend, FastAPI for backend, SQLModel ORM, Neon Serverless PostgreSQL, Better Auth for authentication
No manual coding; use Claude Code for implementation
Development process: Agentic Dev Stack workflow
Scope: Basic features with multi-user support, RESTful API, JWT-based auth
Success criteria:
All 5 features implemented as web app with API endpoints
User authentication working with signup/signin
Data persisted in database, isolated per user
Repository structure includes .spec-kit/config.yaml, specs folders, frontend/backend, README.md, CLAUDE.md files
Zero unhandled exceptions in normal use, secure API access

## RESPONSE_TEXT
Updated the project constitution to align with the full-stack web todo application requirements. The new constitution reflects the requirements for:
- Spec-driven development with Spec-Kit Plus and Claude Code
- Separation of concerns between frontend (Next.js) and backend (FastAPI)
- Secure authentication and data isolation per user using Better Auth
- Responsive and user-friendly web interface
- Persistent storage with Neon Serverless PostgreSQL
- Testable features with both manual and API testing

The constitution now properly reflects the technology stack (Next.js, FastAPI, SQLModel, Neon PostgreSQL, Better Auth) and architecture standards required for the web application, replacing the previous CLI-based todo app principles.

## OUTCOME
The constitution has been successfully updated from version 1.0.0 to 1.1.0, changing from a CLI-based todo app to a full-stack web application with proper authentication, persistent storage, and modern web technologies.

## EVALUATION
The updated constitution aligns with all specified requirements and provides clear guidance for the development of the full-stack web todo application.
