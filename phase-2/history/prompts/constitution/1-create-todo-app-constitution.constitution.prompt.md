## Prompt

```
/sp.constitution
Project: Command-line todo application in Python
Core principles:

Clean code following PEP 8 standards
Modularity for easy maintenance and extension
In-memory storage only (no persistence to files or databases)
User-friendly command-line interface with clear instructions
Key standards:
All features must be testable via manual console interaction
Error handling for invalid inputs
Code organization: Separate concerns (e.g., data models, UI, logic)
Documentation: Inline comments and docstrings
Version control: Git commits with meaningful messages
Constraints:
Technology: Python 3.13+, UV for dependency management
No external libraries beyond standard library
Development process: Spec-driven with Claude Code
Scope: Basic features only (Add, Delete, Update, View, Mark Complete)
Success criteria:
All 5 features implemented and functional
Code passes manual testing for each feature
Repository structure includes specs history, src, README.md, CLAUDE.md
Zero unhandled exceptions in normal use
```

## Response snapshot

Updated the constitution template with specific principles for the todo application project, including core principles around clean code, modularity, in-memory storage, user-friendly CLI, testable features, and error handling. Added sections for constraints, development workflow, and governance based on the project requirements.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Created comprehensive constitution for todo application project with 6 core principles and governance structure
- 🧪 Tests: N/A for constitution creation
- 📁 Files: Updated .specify/memory/constitution.md with project-specific principles
- 🔁 Next prompts: Proceed with creating spec, plan, and tasks based on this constitution
- 🧠 Reflection: Constitution now serves as definitive guide for all development decisions in the project

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: None
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): N/A
- Prompt variant (if applicable): N/A
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): Create feature specification based on constitution
