# Task Generation for Todo Application

## Summary
Generated comprehensive implementation tasks for the command-line todo application based on the specification and implementation plan.

## Details
- Analyzed the feature specification and implementation plan
- Organized tasks by user story priority (P1, P2, P3)
- Created detailed tasks with acceptance criteria and test cases
- Mapped functional requirements to specific implementation tasks
- Organized tasks into 4 implementation phases

## Task Organization
- Phase 1: Core Task Model & Service Layer
- Phase 2: CLI Interface & Command Parsing
- Phase 3: Feature Implementation & Integration
- Phase 4: Testing & Validation

## Outcome
Successfully created detailed implementation tasks with:
- Clear acceptance criteria for each task
- Specific test cases for validation
- Proper mapping to user stories and functional requirements
- Organized by implementation phases for iterative development

## Evaluation
All tasks follow the required format with proper IDs, story labels, and file paths where applicable. Each task is specific enough for implementation while maintaining traceability to the original requirements.
