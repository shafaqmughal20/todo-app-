## Prompt

```
Command-line todo application
Target audience: Developers learning spec-driven development
Focus: Implementing basic CRUD operations for tasks with in-memory storage
Success criteria:

Supports adding tasks with title and description
Lists tasks with ID, title, description, and completion status
Allows updating title or description by ID
Deletes tasks by ID
Marks tasks as complete/incomplete by ID
User can interact via simple text commands
Constraints:
Language: Python 3.13+
Interface: Command-line only
Storage: In-memory list or dict
Timeline: Complete in phases using Agentic Dev Stack
Not building:
Persistent storage (e.g., file or DB saving)
Advanced features like due dates, priorities, or search
GUI or web interface
Authentication or multi-user support
```

## Response snapshot

Created comprehensive feature specification for the todo application with 5 user stories covering all required functionality (add, list, mark complete/incomplete, update, delete). Defined 11 functional requirements and success criteria that are measurable and technology-agnostic. Created quality checklist to validate the specification.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Created complete feature specification with user stories, requirements, and success criteria
- 🧪 Tests: N/A for specification creation
- 📁 Files: Created spec.md and requirements.md checklist files
- 🔁 Next prompts: Proceed with planning using /sp.plan
- 🧠 Reflection: Specification covers all required functionality with clear acceptance criteria

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: None
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): N/A
- Prompt variant (if applicable): N/A
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): Create implementation plan based on this spec
