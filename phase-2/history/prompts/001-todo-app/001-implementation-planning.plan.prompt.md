# Implementation Planning for Todo Application

## Summary
Created comprehensive implementation plan for the command-line todo application following spec-driven development approach.

## Details
- Analyzed the existing specification and identified key architectural decisions
- Designed clean architecture with separation of concerns (CLI, Service, Model layers)
- Created detailed implementation plan with 4 phases
- Defined comprehensive task breakdown with acceptance criteria
- Validated specification quality against requirements

## Architectural Decisions
- Data structure: Dictionary-based storage with auto-incrementing integer IDs for O(1) lookup
- Command parsing: Python's argparse module for robust argument parsing
- Architecture: Clean separation with CLI, Service, and Model layers
- Validation: Input validation with character limits (100 chars for title, 500 for description)

## Outcome
Successfully created all required artifacts for the todo application implementation:
- Implementation Plan (plan.md)
- Detailed Tasks (tasks.md)
- Specification Quality Checklist (checklists/requirements.md)

## Evaluation
All success criteria have been met:
- Clear separation of concerns achieved
- All functional requirements mapped to implementation tasks
- Error handling and validation requirements included
- Architecture follows clean code principles
